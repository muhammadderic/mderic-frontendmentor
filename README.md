# MuhammadDeric Frontend Mentor

This repository is my personal space to tackle **Frontend Mentor challenges** while improving my frontend skills using a modern development stack: **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## About
- My main goal is to **level up frontend development** by practicing with real-world UI challenges.
- I’ve worked with HTML and CSS fundamentals in the past (over 4 years ago), so I won’t focus on re-learning them from scratch.
- Instead, I’ll practice building **frontend applications as they are in modern development** — leveraging components, type safety, and utility-first styling.

## Tech Stack
- ⚛️ React (Component-based UI development)
- 🟦 TypeScript (Type safety and better developer experience)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS (Utility-first styling for rapid prototyping)

## Purpose
This repo is **not about skipping fundamentals** — I already have prior experience with raw HTML & CSS — but rather about:
- Practicing **modern frontend workflows**
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code
- Preparing myself for **production-grade frontend development**
